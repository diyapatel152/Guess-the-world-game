Guess the Word" is a fun, interactive command-line Python game where players try to uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time.

# Technologies Used

# How It Works
- A random word is selected from a fixed list (python, developer, keyboard, etc.).
- The player is shown the word as underscores (e.g., _ _ _ _ _), and must guess the hidden letters.
  
- For each guess:
  If correct, the letter is revealed in its correct position(s).
  If incorrect, the number of allowed guesses (6) decreases.
- The game ends when:
  The player guesses the full word correctly.
  The player runs out of attempts.
